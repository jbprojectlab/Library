# Review Exercise: Data Structures

## Fork the Repo

**Fork this repo** to your own Github account. Then `git clone` your forked repo to your local machine.

## Running the Specs

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`
3. Navigate to the URL displayed by Test'Em

## Exercise Parameters

You may work on the suites in any order, except that to do `HashTable` you need a working `Alist`. Note that some suites are extra credit.

You are free to use any reference materials you find, and are encouraged to meet with instructors or fellows if you get stuck and need some guidance. We only ask that you do not copy and paste code from somewhere else, or look up solutions - doing so will rob you of a valuable learning experience, and make it difficult for us to accurately gauge your comfort level with the material.

## Don't use array methods

For Queues and Stacks: don't use array methods push/pop/shift/unshift functions, nor any other Array.prototype methods, nor .length!

You may use an Object or Array to store your data and keep head and tail pointers (variables) that change when functions like enqueue and dequeue are called.


## Submitting your Code

You are encouraged to make commits frequently. Before the due date, make sure to push up a submission commit:

1. `git commit -am 'submission for deadline'`
2. `git push`
