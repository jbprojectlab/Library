# Test-First Event Emitter

**Note: be sure to read this README.md thoroughly, as well as the comments in the test spec (when you run the tests, a page should open in your browser that displays the comments in a friendly, readable format)**

We are going to be writing the JavaScript implementation of a general Event Emitter. Event emitters are a common pattern for "registering" (storing) functions to be executed at a later time in response to some sort of arbitrary "event".

## Running

You should have Testem installed globally. *If not*: `npm install -g testem`.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm test` - this will cause the specs to run (you can view them at http://localhost:7357/), and will also open an html page with all of the test specs alongside their documentation.
