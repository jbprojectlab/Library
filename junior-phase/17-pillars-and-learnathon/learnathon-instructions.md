From its humble beginnings as a scripting language for the NetScape browser, JavaScript has exploded in popularity in recent years. There are now tons of frameworks for everything from games to music - all based on the fundamental Web technologies of HTML/CSS/JavaScript!

Below is a curated list of some libraries and tools that help us build some awesome things in modern JavaScript. For this learnathon, you and / or a partner will learn about one of these technologies, build something neat with it (probably by building off an existing demo or example), and then give a brief overview of your project and the technology you used to build it.

The goals are exploration, fun, and knowledge. The presentations at the end will be a chance for the entire class to share in what you learned. With that in mind, feel free to find your own library, or to cut your own path entirely if you'd like.
