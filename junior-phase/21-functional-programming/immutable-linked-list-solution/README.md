# Functional (Immutable) Linked List

For this exercise, you will be implementing an immutable linked list!

The specs are located in `functional-linked-list/list.spec.js`.
You will work out of `functional-linked-list/list.js`

There's no need to do anything like install `Immutable` - we can do this from scratch!
