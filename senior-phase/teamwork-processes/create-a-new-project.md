# Teamwork: Create a New Project

When starting a new project, we recommend you (as a team all together or one individualâ€”**Anybody**):

1. **Anybody**: Create a GitHub organization
2. **Anybody**: Add team members (including your fellow and instructor), giving everyone owner privileges
3. **Anybody**: Create a repo in GitHub
4. **Anybody**: Push an initial commit by [cloning boilermaker](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker/#setup)
5. **Anybody**: Protect the master branch (Settings > Branches)
6. **Anybody**: Create a "project" in GitHub and add columns (e.g. *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Needs Review*, and *Done*)
