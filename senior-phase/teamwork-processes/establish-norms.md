# Teamwork: Establish Norms

When starting a new team project, we recommend:

1. **Anybody**: create a google doc / shareable text file somewhere and share it with the whole team 
2. **Everybody**: go through [these questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qquhoredhOu-DCmByEU-KDdJXP6XDL962fwYdl_lLaQ), answering them and using them to guide your norms discussion
3. **Everybody**: look over our [example norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PdSJFN1tqqBDBlDxmLxJOu59or1Nt0DJnFYd0hOrfww) to continue the discussion
4. **Anybody**: put a permanent link to the norms somewhere everybody has access to it
