# Technical interviews

## Categories / types

- algorithm, e.g. *implement mergesort*
- concept questions, e.g. *what is prototypal inheritance*
- trivia, e.g. *what arguments does the `forEach` callback receive*
- architecture / system design, e.g. *design battleship*
- logic / reasoning puzzles, e.g. *how many golf balls fit a bus*
- coding challenge, e.g. *build an app that calculates the distance between two airports*
- project code spelunking, e.g. *walk me through your capstone project code*

## Good technique, across the board

- ASK YOUR INTERVIEWER WHAT THEY WANT
- Enjoy it
- Think out loud, explain your thought process
- Repeat, examples, approach all still apply
- Plan ahead!
- Instead of starting with "I don't know", start with "here's what I remember about that", move from there to related knowledge
- But always be candid if there is something you do not know

## Architecture / system design

- People mean different things for this
- This is everything about your capstone project minus the coding!
- Think about ERDs (schema designs)
- Think about UX flows: what actions can a user take
- Think about the needs and tools involved
- Talk about the pros / cons of choices

## Coding challenge

- Like your senior enrichment project
- Usually has specific business specs
- Usually done on your own, sometimes it will happen on-site as a pair programming experience
- Consider carefully how much time it will take: some of the challenges are pretty large, and give incorrect estimates; if you want to bail you can try to redirect it
- Try to stand out: testing!

## Priorities / which categories to concentrate on

- Prioritize the ones that matter to YOU
- But be careful you're not just choosing what's comfortable
- And / or research the companies you are interest, and focus on what matters to THEM

...

## If I'm stuck checklist...

- Repeat the prompt / clarify / ask questions
