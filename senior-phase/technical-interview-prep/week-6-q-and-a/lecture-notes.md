# Technical interviews

## Categories / types

- algorithm, e.g. *implement mergesort*
- concept questions, e.g. *what is prototypal inheritance*
- trivia, e.g. *what arguments does the `forEach` callback receive*
- architecture / system design, e.g. *design battleship*
- logic / reasoning puzzles, e.g. *how many golf balls fit a bus*
- coding challenge, e.g. *build an app that calculates the distance between two airports*
- project code spelunking, e.g. *walk me through your capstone project code*

## Good technique, across the board

- ASK YOUR INTERVIEWER WHAT THEY WANT
- Enjoy it
- Think out loud, explain your thought process
- Repeat, examples, approach all still apply
- Plan ahead!
- Instead of starting with "I don't know", start with "here's what I remember about that", move from there to related knowledge
- But always be candid if there is something you do not know

## Architecture / system design

- People mean different things for this
- This is everything about your capstone project minus the coding!
- Think about ERDs (schema designs)
- Think about UX flows: what actions can a user take
- Think about the needs and tools involved
- Talk about the pros / cons of choices

## Coding challenge

- Like your senior enrichment project
- Usually has specific business specs
- Usually done on your own, sometimes it will happen on-site as a pair programming experience
- Consider carefully how much time it will take: some of the challenges are pretty large, and give incorrect estimates; if you want to bail you can try to redirect it
- Try to stand out: testing!

## Priorities / which categories to concentrate on

- Prioritize the ones that matter to YOU
- But be careful you're not just choosing what's comfortable
- And / or research the companies you are interest, and focus on what matters to THEM

## If I'm stuck checklist...

- Repeat the prompt / clarify / ask questions
- Like before, talk about what you DO know
- Remember this is natural / expected
- If you need silence, ask for it

*After the fact...*

- Maybe send them a message later if your figured something out
- Reach out to your peers / me / fellows
- Rehahs it, try to play it out differently
- Learn from it

## Helpful tips / how to prepare

- Look up in advance about a company's interview questions (e.g. in GlassDoor)
- Flash cards and quiz yourself (here's some [neat software for that](https://apps.ankiweb.net/))
- [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)! (concept + trivia)
- Flight week 1 in career success workshop has URLS at the bottom (e.g. [here](https://learn.fullstackacademy.com/workshop/585179c6a2b61e00044d8627/content/58517e0fb8822c0004224fb1/text))
- [Â¡nterfeud! slides](../\302\241nterfeud!/) (concept + trivia)
- AlgoExpert + Codewars + Interview Cake + Project Euler + LeetCode (algorithms)
- Cracking on the Coding Interview (algorithms)
- Pramp (mock interviews with random people)
- Side projects!
- Talk at a meetup
- ANYTHING!
